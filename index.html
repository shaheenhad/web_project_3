              Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the
              shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind
              would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which case
              they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and
              the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are
              absolutely amazing.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
              architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If
              you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult
              to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left
              bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though,
              even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.
