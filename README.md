# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

**Intro**

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. I've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Description**

This project showcases responsive web development. The layout and positioning of each section will depend on the size of the screen being used. Written in HTML and CSS using media queries to address responsive requirements. The website can be found at: https://shaheenhad.github.io/web_project_3/
